0. Reread ASSESSMENT and alight the code (rest part especially)
+1. don't commit lib directory as you have pom and maven, Hence each developer will download them to USER/.m2 directory 
2. add tests for PaymentService
3. ADD README
    - how to build
    - configure
    - run the application
    - leftover, what can be refined or improved...weak points in the project...
